======Algorithm====

set value of m = 600
set value of a = 2
set SF as a result
calculate SF by multiply m and a
save the result
show result

======Pseudocode=======

STORE m with value = 600
STORE a WITH VALUE = 2
STORE F with any value
 cALcULATE "m" times "a" 
SET "F" value with calculation result
DISPLAY "SF"
